Codes to do the measuremet of the distance between FMRP puncta and spine

The script 'data_extraction.m': extract and arrange the location data from excel

The script 'rand_FMRP_sim.m': simulate location of FMRP

The script 'rand_spine_sim.m': simulate location of specific spine type

The script 'A2Bdist.m': measure the distance of B from each A

The script 'Main.m': wrap all scripts and read the data from excel folder; conduct the simulation, measurement of specific type of spine and puncta

The codes are runing on Matlab
